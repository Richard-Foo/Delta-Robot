##### Effector
TBD - work in progress.  Current thinking is to use carbon fiber for the structure, shaping it as needed using a 2-part aluminum mold.
However, if it happens that a complex surface is not required, then I'll explore using PCB as the foundation, since a PCB will be needed regardless for the light ring, head connectors, etc.
Objects that may need to be supplied through the effector PCB:
* Light ring
* Camera
* Rotational servo
* Vacuum
* Z probe
* Solder paste extruder
* Accelerometer
* 3D printing head
* Filament feeder (for push/pull design)
* Fan


#### A Few Words About Formats

* *.ipt files are mechanical 3D CAD designs in Autodesk Inventor 2015 format.  A free trial is available, as is a free student license.  A free viewer may also be available.
* *.iam files are assemblies of individual CAD parts (or other assemblies)
* *.tap files are CNC G-code files with a preamble specific to Tormach PCNC-1100
